# SuperBlubberBlasen
SNES version of the awesome BlubberBlasen game

You need:
* The 65618 assembler WLA-DX ([Documentation](https://wla-dx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
* make
* The SNES Emulator Mesen-S to run. So far I don't test other emulator.

Use ```make clean; make``` to build the rom.
