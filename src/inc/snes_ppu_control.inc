                                ; IRQs, HDMAs are kept generated). Forced blank doesn't apply immediately... so one must wait whatever
                                ; (maybe a scanline) before VRAM can be freely accessed... or is it only vice-versa: disabling forced
                                ; blank doesn't apply immediately/shows garbage pixels?
